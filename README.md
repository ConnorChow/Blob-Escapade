                                                        Blob-Escapade
Welcome to Blob's Revenge, a 2D platformer game where you play as a homicidal blob trying to escape from other blobs trying to kill you.

In this game, you can acquire different abilities by picking up drops from enemies or finding them as pickups in levels.

As you progress through the game, you will encounter more powerful enemies, so it's important to collect as many abilities as possible to become stronger. 

If you pick up an ability you already have, it will buff up the current ability, making it more effective.

To control the blob, you can use the A/D keys to strafe and the space bar to jump. You can acquire two types of attacks: the acid shot, activated by the 
left-mouse button, and the power dash, activated by the right-mouse button. Both abilities have cooldowns, which can be lowered by picking up more of the same ability.

The game has multiple levels, each with its own unique enemies and pickups. In the first level, you will learn the mechanics of the game and how to control the blob. 

You can move on to the next level by picking up a key and using it to access the door.

The game's aesthetics are designed with retro spaceships and green slime blobs in mind. 

The enemy blobs are blue and will patrol between two points in idle mode. When they see the player, they will start using their unique attacks to try to kill the player.

The player's health is shown by the color of their sprite and the light they emit. Particle systems are used to animate deaths and impacts.

The game has some bits of dialogue related to the simple story of the game, explaining how to play the game best. The goal of the game is to escape 
from the blobs trying to kill you and become the ultimate blob by assimilating all the other blobs and their abilities.

We hope you enjoy playing Blob's Revenge!
